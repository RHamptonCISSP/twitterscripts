The creation of a Cursor in retweet.py raises this error when the token is invalid or expired.  The error cannot be trapped in try-catch and is probably a failure to handle properly in Tweepy
tweepy.error.TweepError: Twitter error response: status code = 401

Handle keyboard interrupts properly.  Tried these things in autoFollow.py and still got Tracebacks.  https://stackoverflow.com/questions/21120947/catching-keyboardinterrupt-in-python-during-program-shutdown
